DATA STRUCTURE
After discussing it with Codie and Andrea, I restructured the data into one table. Each row represents one Wisconsin county and the columns are named with the year included (i.e., isol09, cip09, cip13, cip15, etc)

DATA CLEANING PROCESS
A pdf with details on my data cleaning process is on Box (.../AMR/Data folder). This doesn't include the step to restructure the data, but that's probably self-explanatory.
