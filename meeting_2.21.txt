DATA STRUCTURE
After discussing it with Codie and Andrea, I restructured the data into one table. Each row represents one Wisconsin county and the columns are named with the year included (i.e., isol09, cip09, cip13, cip15, etc)

DATA CLEANING PROCESS
A pdf with details on my data cleaning process is on Box (.../AMR/Data folder). This doesn't include the step to restructure the data, but that's probably self-explanatory. 

MUSTACHE
Haven't completed the Mustache Lynda course yet, but I think that will help a lot with the implementation of things like dynamically changing title (Cipro 2009 to Levo 2013, etc)

STYLING
Will worry about styling after all the functionality is there

MEETINGS
I've established that I'm not great at asking for help via email! Let's get another meeting with Codie & Andrea scheduled (next Wed or Fri) to run over some of the Carto code and questions. 


ANDREA and CODIE to discuss coding questions that arise:
	WED, FEB 28th between 1-5pm CT?

FINAL MEETING with everyone to officially pass off the project to SCO:
	WED, MAR 7th between 1-5pm CT?
